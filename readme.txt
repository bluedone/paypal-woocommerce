= Quality Control =
Payment processing can't go wrong.  It's as simple as that.  Our certified PayPal engineers have developed and thoroughly tested this plugin on the PayPal sandbox (test) servers to ensure your customers don't have problems paying you.  

= Seamless PayPal Integration =
Stop bouncing back and forth between WooCommerce and PayPal to manage and reconcile orders.  We've made sure to include all WooCommerce order data in PayPal transactions so that everything matches in both places.  If you're looking at a PayPal transaction details page it will have all of the same data as a WooCommerce order page, and vice-versa.  

= Error Handling =
PayPal's system can be tricky when it comes to handling errors.  Most PayPal plugins do not correctly process the PayPal response which can result in big problems.  For example:

* Fraud Filters could throw a "warning" instead of a full "success" response even when the payment was completed successfully.  
* Many plugins treat these as failures and customers end up with duplicate payments if they continue to retry.

Our plugins always handle these warnings/errors correctly so that you do not have to worry about dealing with those types of situations.

= Localization = 
The PayPal Express Checkout buttons and checkout pages will translate based off your WordPress language setting by default.  The rest of the plugin was also developed with localization in mind and is ready for translation.

If you're interested in helping translate please [let us know](http://www.angelleye.com/contact-us/)!

= Get Involved =
Developers can contribute to the source code on the [PayPal for WooCommerce GitHub repository](https://github.com/angelleye/paypal-woocommerce).

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WooCommerce 2.1 or higher

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of PayPal for WooCommerce, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type PayPal for WooCommerce and click Search Plugins. Once you've found our plugin you can view details about it such as the the rating and description. Most importantly, of course, you can install it by simply clicking Install Now.

= Manual Installation =

1. Unzip the files and upload the folder into your plugins folder (/wp-content/plugins/) overwriting older versions if they exist
2. Activate the plugin in your WordPress admin area.
 
= Usage = 

1. Open the settings page for WooCommerce and click the "Checkout" tab
2. Click on the sub-item for PayPal Express Checkout or Payments Pro.
3. Enter your API credentials and adjust any other settings to suit your needs. 

= Updating = 

Automatic updates should work great for you.  As always, though, we recommend backing up your site prior to making any updates just to be sure nothing goes wrong.
